Welcome to MasonLiebe's GitHub! 👋
==================================

About Me
--------

Hello! I'm Mason, and I’m deeply passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and finance. With a keen interest in **Quantitative Finance**, **Prediction Market Trading**, **Machine Learning & AI**, and **Statistics & Data Science**, I thrive on challenging the status quo and leveraging data to predict and shape future trends.

What I'm Learning Right Now
---------------------------

*   🗣️ **Natural Language Processing & Machine Learning:** Enhancing my skills in ML with a specific focus on PyTorch to develop and implement models that can understand and generate human language.
*   🌐 **Blockchain Technology:** Currently diving deep into the world of decentralized technologies and their applications.  Also doing side research in Post-Quantum Cryptography.
*   📈 **Market Making on Prediction Markets:** Learning the nuances of liquidity provision on platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket, aiming to improve market efficiency and accessibility.
*   🧑🏻‍💻 **Leecode:** Unfortunately lol.  But I just started doing competitions and their actually pretty fun!

Fun Facts
---------

*   ⚡ I spent a year traveling across Asia, visiting countries such as Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This experience not only broadened my horizons but also deeply influenced my professional and personal worldview.
*   ⚡ I spent 3 years working as an Actuary before my CS masters, even spending 1k hours of my life getting my [Actuarial Credential](https://www.actuarial-lookup.com/results/fgdbxp), working in Medicaid pricing at UnitedHealth Group.
*   ⚡ I've recently taken up daily mental math practice, and have been tracking my progress. After 2 months of practice, I'm now able to score 93 on [this](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/) tool that a lot of quant trading people use
