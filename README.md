Welcome to MasonLiebe's GitHub! 👋
==================================

About Me
--------

Hello! I'm Mason, I am a CS Masters student at Penn.

What I'm Learning Right Now
---------------------------

*   🗣️ **Natural Language Processing & Machine Learning:**  Building a [repo](https://github.com/MasonLiebe/ML-For-Stocks) with all sorts of ML models for the usecase of stock prediction. 
*   🌐 **Blockchain Technology:** Learning how blockchain actually works, trading on-chain and through exchanges, and learning how to harness the utility of the Web3 ecosystem for broad usecases.  Also doing side research in Post-Quantum Cryptography, specifically lattice-based cryptography.
*   📈 **Market Making on Prediction Markets:** I build and deploy systematic trading systems on the Polymarket and Kalshi prediction markets, my strategies are built around 2-way market making and informed speculation betting.
*   🧑🏻‍💻 **Leetcode:** I just started doing competitions here and they're actually pretty fun!

Fun Facts
---------

*   🌏 I spent a year traveling East Asia, visiting countries such as Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This experience not only broadened my horizons but also deeply influenced my professional and personal worldview.
*   ⚡ I spent 3 years working as an Actuary before my CS masters, even spending 1k hours of my life getting my [Actuarial Credential](https://www.actuarial-lookup.com/results/fgdbxp), working in Medicaid pricing at UnitedHealth Group.
*   🏀 I am a huge Wisconsin sports fan. The Bucks, and more broadly the NBA, are my primary sports interests, but I also watch every Packer game and enjoy following the NFL as well.
